# Linear-Algebra-Linear-Regression

## Dataset description

The data you will work on for this Sprint Challenge is from the World Happiness Report. The report compiles data from a survey of hundreds of countries and looks at factors such as economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity to determine a happiness "score".

In this Sprint Challenge, we're only going to look at the report for years 2018 and 2019. We're going to see how much the happiness "score" depends on some of the factors listed above.
